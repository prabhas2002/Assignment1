# Contractive Representation Learning on CIFAR Dataset

This repository contains the implementation of a classification problem on the CIFAR dataset using Contractive Representation Learning. 

## Overview

The approach involves using an encoder to embed the CIFAR images into a d-dimensional space. A classifier is then used to perform a 10-class classification on these embedded images.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is CIFAR-10, which consists of 10 balanced classes. Each image in the dataset has a shape of 32x32x3.

## Methodology

1. **Encoding**: The CIFAR images are embedded into a d-dimensional space using an encoder.

2. **Classification**: A classifier is used on the encoded images to perform a 10-class classification.
